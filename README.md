## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project we learn the basics of networking and th Internet Protocol.
Most of the questions use the IP calculator.

## üìù Notes <a name = "notes"></a>

### TCP

TCP sends information to a siingle known host.
The information's integrity is pretty much guaranteed by extensive error-checking.
All packets arrive in order, and it's slower than UDP.
It's used in SMTP, HTTP, FTP and many others.

### UDP

UPD listens and broadcasts data to and from anything else that's listening.
The only error-checking it has is a checksum in each package.
It's used for DHCP (if you don't have an IP you can't use TCP), Voice over IP,
DNS, some streaming protocols, and more.

### DHCP

It's what assigns dynamic IPs to devices in a network.
Supports IPv4 and IPv6.

### ping

A common networking tool that checks if a host is online and connected. Uses ICMP.

### IP classes

Class A is the largest, with almost 17 million assignable IP addresses.
Used by very large organizations.

### Hosts in a Network

The ammount of assignable IPs in a subnet is always `pow(2, ip_bits_available) - 2`

### Network and Broadcast IPs

Network always ends with a 0.
The broadcast address is the last adressable IP.
Any package sent to the broadcast address is received by all hosts in the network.

### DNS

It's a program running on a server somewhere that tells you which IP belongs to `google.com`:

```bash
$ nslookup google.com
```

### Private IP

They all start with 192, 172 and 10.

## üõ∏ 42 S√£o Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
